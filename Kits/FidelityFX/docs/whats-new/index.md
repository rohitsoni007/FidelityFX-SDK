<h3>AMD FSR™ Upscaling 4.1.1</h3>

- Added support for AMD FSR™ Upscaling 4.1 on AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series (AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture) discrete GPUs

<h3>AMD FSR™ Frame Generation 4.0.1</h3>

- Version updates for ML-based frame generation and Frame Generation Swapchain
- Fix motion vector pre-processing for generation rectangle
- Fix binding of camera information for motion vector pre-processing
- Redundant version check removals
- Frame Generation Swapchain: 
  - Fix race condition on shutdown/disabling of Frame Generation with semaphore waitable object
  - Fix to shutdown handling to prevent hanging resource pointers

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution Frame Generation Swapchain 3.1.7</h3>

- Fixed race condition on shutdown in `GetFrameLatencyWaitableObject()`: each call now returns an independent handle with its own lifetime. The application must call `CloseHandle()` on each returned handle.
- Improved frame latency waitable object behavior to ensure correct GPU frame pacing.

<h3>AMD FSR™ API</h3>

* Minor non-API breaking additions:<br/>
- Added `ffxConfigureDescGlobalDebug` (type 7) — a new debug configuration struct with an `effectId` field enabling per-effect debug message routing.<br/>

<h2>Updated Components</h2>

Starting with AMD FidelityFX™ SDK 2.0.0 the effects, previously combined in amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll, are split into multiple DLLs based on effect type. Please see [Introduction to AMD FSR™ API](../getting-started/ffx-api.md#dlls-structure) for details.
<br/>
<br/>
PDBs are provided for the loader DLL.

<h2>Updated documentation</h2>

* AMD FSR™ Ray Regeneration 1.2.0 documentation.
* AMD FSR™ Upscaling 4.1.1 documentation.
* AMD FSR™ Frame Generation 4.0.1 documentation.
* AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution Frame Generation 3.1.6 API documentation.
* AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution Frame Generation Swapchain 3.1.7 documentation.

<h2>Deprecated effects</h2>

None.

<h2>Deprecated components</h2>

All SDK version 1 effects are now deprecated to that version of the SDK. 
For any pre-existing AMD FidelityFX™ features (including the legacy AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution sample), please refer to AMD FidelityFX™ SDK 1.1.4.
