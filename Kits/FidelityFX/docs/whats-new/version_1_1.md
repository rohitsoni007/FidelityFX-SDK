<h1>What's new in the AMD FidelityFX™ SDK 1.1?</h1>

Welcome to the AMD FidelityFX™ SDK. This updated version of the SDK contains various fixes, support for the Microsoft® GDK (available from Microsoft through the GDK), and 3 new effects in the AMD FidelityFX™ family.

<h2>New effects and features</h2>

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Breadcrumbs library</h3>

The first release of a library to help detect sources of GPU crashes. With a breadcrumb markers technique you can track down where your submitted commands cause GPU crashes and save time when analysing the rendering process in search of faulty commands.

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Brixelizer</h3>

A highly-optimized GPU sparse distance field builder that can handle both static and dynamic geometry and features a shader API that allows you to trace rays against the scene from any shader of your choice.  

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Brixelizer GI</h3>

A compute-based real-time dynamic global illumination solution built upon the sparse distance fields built by AMD FidelityFX™ Brixelizer. It provides you with denoised indirect diffuse and specular lighting outputs that you can composite into your final lighting output and is ideal as a fallback for ray-traced global illumination on lower end hardware.

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3)</h3>

AMD FidelityFX™ 3.1 has been added to the AMD FidelityFX™ FSR sample. FSR 3.1 contains significant updates:
* FSR 3.1 Upscaler reduces ghosting, improves convergence speed and reduces flickering. 
* Frame pacing for FSR Frame Interpolation has been improved for an even better experience.
* FSR3.1 adds the ability to decouple the frame interpolation process from that of upscaling, so it can be used with any upscaler the user desires, or at native resolution.
* FSR 3.1 introduces the FSR API, which makes integrations of FSR future proof, so applications using this interface can be updated to upcoming versions of FSR more easily.

The sample also includes support for dynamic resolution scaling cases of upscaler/frame interpolation usage.

FSR 3.1 also includes a number of fixes for issues discovered with FSR 3.0.2 and 3.0.4.

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution (FSR) API</h3>

A new API has been added for forward compatibility.

Major differences to the previous API for FSR:

* Only has 5 functions with most information exchanged through structures with the ability to add extensions.
* Requires linking to a single AMD FidelityFX™ DLL, pre-built and signed by AMD.
* Backend contexts are created by the API.
  * Custom backends are no longer supported. Only the native DirectX 12 and Vulkan backends are available through this API.

<h3>AMD FidelityFX™ GDK Backend</h3>

The AMD FidelityFX™ SDK now supports compiling natively to the Microsoft GDK for desktop and Xbox Series X/S. In order to use the GDK backend, please see the AMD FidelityFX™ samples shipped with the latest version of Microsoft's GDK.
